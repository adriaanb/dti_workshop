# Motion Sensor

This PIR Motion Sensor is designed to detect human motion by measuring infrared radiation emitted by objects in its field of view. It operates as a digital component, making it simple to use in code. If the sensor value you read is `True`, a motion is being detected. `False` means no motion is detected.   

The sensor has a detecting angle of 100 degrees and can sense motion at distances ranging from 3.2 meters to 12 meters.

## Basic Usage
```python
# --- Imports
import digitalio
import time
import board

# --- Variables
motion_sensor = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.GP16)
motion_sensor.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT

# --- Functions

# --- Setup

# --- Main loop
while True:
    if motion_sensor.value == True:
        print("A Motion has occured")
    else:
        print("Nothing...")
        
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
