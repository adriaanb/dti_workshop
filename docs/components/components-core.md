## Core Components

{: .important }
There are **multiple, functionally equivalent editions** of Connected Interaction Kit. The Core Components you own differ slightly between editions. Your exact components are determined by the year in which you purchased your Connected Interaction Kit. This page is designed to help you identify which version you own.

If in doubt, jump to the bottom of the page for helpful pointers on how to [recognize your hardware](#recognizing-your-components).

## Recognizing your components

### Which Bitsy Expander do I have?

<p align="center">

</p>



The easiest way to identify which Bitsy Expander flavor you own is checking the label on the back of the board. **RP2040** or **M4** stated on the label indicates the flavor of your Expander. Older M4 Expanders have an **empty label** (and are also recognizable by the lack of an IÂ²C header at the top). 

### Which ItsyBitsy Development Board do I have?

</p>



The **ItsyBitsy M4 Express** features **one (RESET) button**. (So do most other ItsyBitsy Development boards, so always verify with the silkscreen.)
The **ItsyBitsy RP2040** features **two (BOOT, RESET) buttons**.
